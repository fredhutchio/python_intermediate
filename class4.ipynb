    "# Intermediate Python: Programming\n",
    "# Class 4\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course,\n",
    "we've learned about different programming structures in Python to assist in automating tasks, \n",
    "and also explored ways to document and define defaults for functions.\n",
    "In today's class, \n",
    "we'll complete the course by thinking about ways we can make our functions as robust and reusable as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this class,\n",
    "you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- perform debugging on functions creating errors\n",
    "- understand principles of test-driven development\n",
    "- write command-line programs for Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging \n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous class, \n",
    "we discussed testing and validating our code.\n",
    "If you do identify a problem that either prevents the code from working,\n",
    "or that prevents the code from accomplishing the task you had in mind,\n",
    "you'll need to debug your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you would like additional explanations for the concepts covered in this section, more detail is available in the original lessons from [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/11-debugging/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging code associated with research analysis is particularly challenging.\n",
    "We're writing code to find out an answer to a question, \n",
    "so validating that our answers are accurate is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping in mind your overall goal for what the code should accomplish, \n",
    "a reasonable process for writing research software includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Testing with subset data:* Use a few example data points for testing before moving on to the entire dataset.\n",
    "- *Testing with simplified data:* Use synthetic data, or subset to a simpler unit (e.g., only one chromosome instead of the entire genome.\n",
    "- *Compare to known findings:* Use well-established reports from previously published literature, specifically from model systems, to confirm your software is finding equivalent results.\n",
    "- *Check conservation laws:* Use summary statistics to confirm the number of samples included doesn't vary in unexpected ways. For example, if you are filtering out data, the number of data points should decreased rather than increase.\n",
    "- *Visualize:* Although it's difficult to compare figures in an automated way (e.g., with a computer), we can use data visualizations to confirm our assumptions are being met. In fact, we modeled this approach in earlier classes in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll generally \n",
    "With these general steps in mind,\n",
    "let's explore some specific approaches to assist in the debugging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Ensure failures are consistent.* Double check that you've executed all the code that your problem code needs to run, and that you're using the data you initially intended. It's easy to blame the code for not working, when it's actually a mistake we made when trying to run it.\n",
    "- *Fail quickly and efficiently:* Minimize the time it takes to get the error to resurface, and isolate the portion of the code involved.\n",
    "- *Change one thing at a time*: Make only one alteration before testing your code again, and be rational in choosing what change to try next.\n",
    "- *Keep track of what you've done:* Don't make yourself repeat an experiment, and also be able to remember what happened when you last tried something.\n",
    "- *Ask for help:* Whether someone in your lab group, other members of your computational community, or strangers online, you might be able to save yourself a lot of time and energy by leveraging someone else's expertise. As a bonus, it's possible that framing your problem in terms someone else could understand will help you figure it out on your own!\n",

    "#### Challenge-debug\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code computes the Body Mass Index (BMI) of patients. \n",
    "BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres.\n",
    "The test results indicate all patients appear to have have unusual and identical BMIs, \n",
    "despite having different physiques. \n",
    "What suggestions do you have to improve this code?\n",

    "## Test-driven development\n",
    "\n",
    "Our normal tendency when writing software is to:\n",
    "- Write a function.\n",
    "- Call it interactively on two or three different inputs.\n",
    "- If it produces the wrong answer, fix the function and re-run that test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better practice is to:\n",
    "- Write a short function for each test.\n",
    "- Write a function that should pass those tests.\n",
    "- If the function produces any wrong answers, fix it and re-run the test functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This latter process is called test-driven development (TDD),\n",
    "and is a way of thinking about designing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section,\n",
    "we'll write a function to assess whether input ranges overlap.\n",
    "We'll apply practices of test-driven development,\n",
    "and also apply many of the programming methods we've developed over the duration of this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We're not applying TDD to our inflammation data because we've already written the functions. \n",
    "We've chosen a small stand-alone task for this section to demonstrate TDD, \n",
    "but we'll get back to our inflammation data in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by writing three test functions for our function, \n",
    "which we'll call `range_overlap`.\n",
    "This first set of tests are \"positive controls\"\n",
    "that should work for multiple types of input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# one input\n",
    "assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0) \n",
    "# two inputs\n",
    "assert range_overlap([ (2.0, 3.0), (2.0, 4.0) ]) == (2.0, 3.0) \n",
    "# three inputs\n",
    "assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 2.0), (-1.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run these, errors are expected! \n",
    "We haven't written the function yet.\n",
    "If tests passed we'd know we were accidentally using someone else's function.\n",
    "These tests implicitly define what our input and output look like: a list of pairs as input, and produce a single pair as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can write a test for when ranges do not overlap:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (5.0, 6.0) ]) == None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we've made the decision that no overlap means there is no output.\n",
    "Alternatively, we could create a failure with an error message,\n",
    "or a special value (`(0.0, 0.0)`) to indicate no overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll test for when ranges touch at their endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 2.0) ]) == None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we need to decide (in the context of our research)\n",
    "whether this counts as overlap.\n",
    "Here, we've decided overlaps need to have non-zero width, \n",
    "so no output will be reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it's good practice to include an error for when the input is completely missing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assert range_overlap([]) == None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll actually write our function (spoiler: there are errors in this):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### range_overlap\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def range_overlap(ranges):\n",
    "    '''Return common overlap among a set of [left, right] ranges.'''\n",
    "    max_left = 0.0\n",
    "    min_right = 1.0\n",
    "    for (left, right) in ranges:\n",
    "        max_left = max(max_left, left)\n",
    "        min_right = min(min_right, right)\n",
    "    return (max_left, min_right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And define our test function:\n",

    "#### test_range_overlap\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_range_overlap():\n",
    "    assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (5.0, 6.0) ]) == None\n",

    "    assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)\n",

    "    assert range_overlap([]) == None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll test our function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "test_range_overlap()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first test was supposed to produce `None`, \n",
    "but it fails!\n",
    "Now we know we need to correct our function.\n",
    "Note that we don't know if any other tests failed, \n",
    "because the program halts after the first error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, \n",
    "our function is not working because we've initialized with absolute values, instead of real data. \n",
    "\n",
