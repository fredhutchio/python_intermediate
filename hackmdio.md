This page is for easy access to links we'll use during class. You don't need to do anything with this information until directed by your instructor. Links to the instructor's script will be added as the course progresses.

**Sign in to each class meeting** [here](https://goo.gl/forms/j4MbWJuPoIYeJET12)

You should have Python installed on your computer, as well as a preferred interface for writing Python code. You can view some recommendations [here](http://www.fredhutch.io/resources/#intermediate-python-programming). Your instructor will be using Atom (with separately installed Hydrogen and Python) for this course.
