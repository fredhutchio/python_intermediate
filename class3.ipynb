    "# Class 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous class, \n",
    "we explored how to make decisions using code,\n",
    "how to write our own functions,\n",
    "and how to connect these programming structures with for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, \n",
    "we'll learn additional ways to improve the usability and robustness of our functions.\n",
    "By the end of this class, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- identify and correct different types of errors as reported by python\n",
    "- test and validate complex functions\n",

    "## Interpreting errors\n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably noticed by now that a lot of time spent coding\n",
    "is actually spent troubleshooting after receiving a warning or error.\n",
    "Let's look at some of the error messages you're likely to receive,\n",
    "and think about ways you may be able to resolve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Errors are defined as problems with the basic way code is written.\n",
    "Exceptions refer to external features of code (like variable names)\n",
    "that interrupt the flow of the program.\n",
    "We'll discuss them in this section collectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the following code, \n",
    "which wraps an example we covered in our last class inside a function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pos_neg(x):\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        print(x, \"is positive\")\n",
    "    elif x == 0: \n",
    "        print(x, \"is zero\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(x, \"is negative, will be converted\")\n",
    "        x = -x\n",

    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The error messages in Python are called tracebacks. \n",
    "It includes enough information that you should be able to determine which part of your code created the error, \n",
    "and ideally,\n",
    "how to correct it.\n",
    "The number of arrows on the lefthand side indicate the number of levels of the error.\n",
    "Here, there are two levels. \n",
    "The first arrow points to line 11,\n",
    "in which the function is called.\n",
    "This traces back to the second arrow,\n",
    "in line 2,\n",
    "which is where the actual error has occurred. \n",
    "The last line of the traceback tells us the type of error and how that error relates to our code. \n",
    "In this case, \n",
    "we're trying to use `>` to compare 0, an integer,\n",
    "with `x`, a string (`num`, which we were using to test our function,\n",
    "and has accidentally been assigned using quotation marks).\n",
    "These different types of data can't be compared in this way.\n",
    "We could resolve this by using an integer to test our code instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of errors you'll see reported from Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are related to the basic symbols used to specify actions in code.\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing a symbol\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fahr_to_celsius(temp)\n",
    "    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))\n",
    "```\n",
    "There is a colon missing at the end of the first line,\n",
    "where the function is defined,\n",
    "and is reported as `SyntaxError`,\n",
    "with the explanation of `invalid syntax`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fahr_to_celsius(temp):\n",
    "return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The indentation at the beginning of the second line is missing, \n",
    "which is reported as `IndentationError` because `expected an indented block`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation matters in Python,\n",
    "as whitespace (tabs and spaces) is how code chunks are organized into units.\n",
    "Python doesn't allow mixing of whitespace types, \n",
    "so many interpreters correct spaces that are meant to be tabs.\n",
    "Keep in mind that this isn't a failsafe against all possible syntax errors of this type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable name errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you're trying to print something:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(octopus)\n",
    "```\n",
    "You'll see a `NameError`,\n",
    "specifically, \n",
    "that `name 'octopus' is not defined`.\n",
    "One common reason for this is because octopus isn't a variable, \n",
    "but rather, a string around which you forgot to place quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common problem is if you forgot to create a variable before using it,\n",
    "or if you have a typo (e.g., capitalization mismatch) between variable references:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"octopus\"\n",
    "print(Name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index errors\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are attempting to access an element in a list,\n",
    "but there is no element at the index position specified,\n",
    "you'll receive an `IndexError`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"octopus\"\n",
    "name[7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "For this error, the explanation is `string index out of range`.\n",
    "This means that the string,\n",
    "`octopus`, does not have a character at index position 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File errors\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had a typo in a filename when trying to load data in one of our previous classes, \n",
    "you probably saw an error citing `OSError`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "data = np.loadtxt(fname=\"data/inflamation-01.csv\", delimiter=\",\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The explanation is that the file is `not found`,\n",
    "which means that either the name of the file is wrong,\n",
    "or its location isn't correct (e.g., if you forgot to include `data/` before the filename).\n",
    "\n",
    "> These are the most common errors you're likely to encounter, \n",
    "although this list is not exhaustive. \n",
    "The Python documentation explains [built-in errors and exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html), \n",
    "although if you're using someone else's code, \n",
    "it's possible they've written a custom exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge-errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the error message included below the code, \n",
    "identify the type of error and why it is occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Code:*\n",

    "2. *Does the code meet stated goal?*\n",
    "Ensuring the code performs specific tasks that meet our specific need is referred to as **validation**,\n",
    "and requires careful inspection of the tasks performed by the code,\n",
    "as well as how they fit into the rest of the software being used.\n",
